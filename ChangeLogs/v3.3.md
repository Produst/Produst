## Minor backend change for managing configurations

* Remove the old logic for managing the json based configurations used by the old node.js version.

## New Guilds

Once upon a time, WarBOT would automatically attempt to configure itself, by looking at the various roles and permissions in your server.
Since, the bot now contains a decent setup wizard, By default, it will disable all features, until somebody executes bot, setup.
bot, setup is advertised automatically when warbot joins the discord guild.

## bot, stats
Stats will now show the total user count.

# Bug Fixes

## Missing Permissions

* If WarBOT is unable to post to the channel you configured for WAR notifications
* AND WarBOT is unable to post an error in the officers channel you configured (if you did)
* AND WarBOT is unable to DM the owner of the discord server
* WarBOT will automatically disable sending war notifications to your server.

# New Commands / Updated Commands

* bot, reset config / set defaults
This config will now reset most of the settings to empty / not configured, instead of guessing what values to use. 'bot, setup' exists to assist with reconfiguration.
