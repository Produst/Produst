Version 3.0 of bot. Will be converted to use .net core.

# Major Changes

## Portal Remindar

### WarBOT will now send a message once a week when the portal is opened!

### To Change the message:

* bot, set portal (Put Your Message Here)

### To enable, or disable

* bot, disable portal
* bot, enable portal

# Minor Changes

## Dialogs

Dialogs will automatically clean up messages after the dialog is closed.

# Bug Fixes

## Bot's Prefix

I noticed a bug where many people were getting Command not found errors when doing simple things like bot, help.

I realized, they had the prefix set to 'bot' and not 'bot,' so the command was being interpreted as ', help' instead of 'help'.

This release rolls out a fix, which will automatically handle a preceding comma.

# New Commands / Updated Commands

* Added command related to portal notification management.
